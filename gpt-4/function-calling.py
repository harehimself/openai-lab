## This example demonstrates a hypothetical function call to an API endpoint for generating text, like using the GPT model.

import openai

## Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

## Function call to the OpenAI API
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you?'",
    max_tokens=60,
)

## Print the generated text
print(response.choices[0].text)


## In this example:
## You need to replace 'your-api-key' with your actual OpenAI API key.
## openai.Completion.create is the function call to the API. It takes several parameters, such as engine, prompt, and max_tokens.
## The engine parameter specifies which model to use (e.g., "text-davinci-003").
## The prompt parameter contains the input text you want the model to respond to.
## max_tokens specifies the maximum length of the response.
## The response is then printed out.
## Note: This is just a basic example. The actual implementation may vary based on your specific use case and the API's updates or changes.
